**Next-generation DeFi network enabling programmable liquidity across multiple protocols**

## What is Mitosis?

Mitosis is a Network for Programmable Liquidity that leads the next generation of DeFi through the tokenization of liquidity positions while ensuring seamless integration into the Mitosis Ecosystem. It transforms traditional DeFi positions into tokenized, programmable assets that can be seamlessly leveraged across multiple protocols. Mitosis allows liquidity providers to deposit once and seamlessly earn rewards across multiple protocols in the ecosystem, where your liquidity works harder and smarter.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum-compatible blockchain, Mitosis allows users to connect to the network and interact with smart contracts using familiar Ethereum tooling. Building a successful blockchain requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Mitosis is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node's crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them.

2. **Performance**: Mitosis aims to be fast, leveraging the proven Cosmos SDK architecture with full EVM compatibility. We optimize for DeFi and cross-chain operations with minimal latency.

3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Mitosis is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3) plus the Open Interoperability Requirement (OIR), we want developers to use it freely and promote interoperability.

4. **EVM Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Ethereum tooling, wallets, and infrastructure. Run your Ethereum dApps without changes while leveraging advanced Cosmos features.

5. **Developer Experience**: Unified development experience using Solidity for all logic, standard Ethereum tooling, and familiar wallet integration.
